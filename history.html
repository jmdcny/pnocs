             <p><span class="centertext">The Officer Candidate  School traces its humble beginnings at School for Reserve Commission in 1937. According to Section 34, Article IV of the National Defense Act, the school came into existence. Under the SRC, three Branch Schools were organized: the Field Artillery School in Camp del Pilar, Dau, Mabalacat, Pampanga, Infantry School in Camp Ord, Tarlac, Infantry School in Camp Keithly, Lanao. These schools continued to operate until WWII. <br/><br/>
             Pursuant to AFP GHQ General Orders No. 412 s-54 :After the war, the SRC was reactivated and assigned with the Philippine Army School Center (PASC), Philippine Army Training Command in Fort McKinley, Rizal.
